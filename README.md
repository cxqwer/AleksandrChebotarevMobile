# TO RUN TESTS USE .XML FILES IN "SRC\TEST\RESOURCES\" DIRECTORY.

Tasks:
1. Change settings to run web test on a certain iOS device in mobile cloud. Run test with your changes. Did test pass? 
    - Yes!
2. Change settings to run native test on a certain/random Android device in mobile cloud. Add support of appPackage and appActivity parameters for Android devices (reading from a .properties file and then setting in the DesiredCapabilities). Locally installed Appium DT has no need in these parameters, but for Appium server of EPAM mobile cloud itâ€™s mandatory.
     - OK!    
3. Run test with your changes. Did test pass? 
    - Yes!
4. Try to use autoLaunch capability with app as before instead of appPackage and appActivity. Does this approach work?
    - No, test falls with exception:
"org.openqa.selenium.SessionNotCreatedException: Unable to create a new remote session. Please check the server log for more details. Original error: {"status":13,"value":{"message":"An unknown server-side error occurred while processing the command. Original error: The desired capabilities must include either an app, appPackage or browserName"},"sessionId":null} (WARNING: The server did not provide any stacktrace information)"
